            <div class="border3">
            <p>This post is the first of my <strong><a
                    href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;q=%23saxeburg-series&amp;src=typd"

                entrepreneurs (or the young at heart), in which we’ll learn about Neo4j and have some fun at the same time. How?
                By building our own Neo4j-powered mobile game.</p>

            <div class="border3">
            <p>Have you ever wondered how apps like Google Maps or Waze provide turn by turn directions and
                offer the fastest
                route, as well as respond to changing traffic conditions in realtime?</p>
            <p>Today I will show you how to use Neo4j for traffic routing, and it will only take a few
                minutes.</p>
            <p>As you will soon see, we could pick any city that we like as a case study, however for the sake
                of this article
                let us imagine a sprawling nation-state that is part Paris, part Metro Manila and part Coney
                Island. Are you
                with me?</p>
            <p>Such a city could be represented in topographical form like this:</p>
            <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mNEeCZj.jpg" alt="Saxeburg"><br>
                <em>Saxeburg, c. 1986</em></p>
            </div>
            <div class="border3">
            <h2 id="Doctor-Cerulean">Doctor Cerulean</h2>
            <p>Towards the task at hand let us also imagine Dr Cerulean, the charismatic founding forefather of
                our thriving
                metropolis. Charisma aside, he is unfortunately a calamitously lazy man and one prone to
                numerous vices at that.
                Most especially wine, women and song.</p>
            <p>We are going somewhere with this, but I would ask that you please stretch your imagination <em>just</em>
                a little
                more, to accommodate the following notion: On the night before he was due to present an
                inaugural city charter,
                our dear Doctor was down in Phoenix sampling the Cactus Juice, which is very good down that way.
                And
                unfortunately also lethal on this occasion.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="The-Last-Day-of-Doctor-Cerulean’s-Life">The Last Day of Doctor Cerulean’s Life</h2>
            <div class="border3">
            <p>OK, so here we are on the last day of our city founding father’s last day of life. We will get to
                the traffic
                routing in a moment, but I think we better address this matter at least briefly, as it would be
                disrespectful to brush over, wouldn’t it?</p>
            <p>Doctor Cerulean commenced his last day, after waking from an hour or two of sleep. He discovered
                himself in a
                compromising position, but was otherwise feeling quite fantastic. Violently alive, you could
                say. The city
                charter, however was nowhere in site, the task of preparing one having been neglected for months
                prior.</p>
            <p>You might think this sounds like the start of a day where things aren’t going to go necessarily
                all that well,
                and you’d be right.</p>
            <p>However, at this point, I can elaborate on some of the soon-to-be departed Doctor’s redeeming
                qualities. For one,
                he is deliciously playful. Two, he’s remarkably resourceful and quite inventive to boot.</p>
            <p>You see, the night prior, there was a fantastic party taking place in the science department of
                Phoenix’ very
                party-oriented fledgling university campus. Thus, the Doctor found himself, that morning,
                regaining some
                semblance of consciousness drooling onto a Periodic Table of Elements.</p>
            <p>Having awoken at ten, and due to present the city charter at eleven, our Doctor performed a
                momentous feat. He
                gathered up the table of elements, crossed out the carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; oxygen;
                sulphur; selenium
                various noble gasses and so forth until there was nothing left but what? Exactly: <em>metal</em>.
                On top of
                this, he scrawled, in black marker pen: “The People Will Rock!”.</p>
            <p>And so, this is the document he presented in lieu of an actual city charter, in front of the
                assembled town hall,
                and those were in fact the last words he uttered. They were spoken with enthusiasm and with arm
                held aloft,
                fingers formed into a pair of horns.</p>
            <p>He then promptly collapsed and died, on stage, making quite a show of it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="border3">
            <p>The doctors (actual qualified ones) wrote “general congestion in all systems”, which was a polite
                way of saying
                “excess of Cactus Juice”, back in those days.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="Don’t-Cry">Don’t Cry</h2>
            <div class="border3">
            <p>Finally, here ready to commence our traffic routing exercise! Woo hoo! However, hmmmm . . . now
                I’m a little
                worried about you.</p>
            <p>Maybe this story of Doctor Cerulean, has moved you. Rocked your emotional core, so to speak.
                Perhaps even to the
                point of overcoming your powers of cognition. The thing is, you are going to need those.</p>
            <p>Therefore I would say to you this: Do not shed a tear! The good Doctor’s statue stands aloft in
                Intramuros to
                this day. He is looking very dapper, albeit simultaneously a little worse for wear. His arm is
                raised, just as
                it was in those last moments, in an ever enduring veneration of metal and hard-living.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile Saxeburg is thriving, it really is. And I tell you <em>what</em>, the people certainly
                did rock! Every
                neighbourhood adopted an elemental metal, enshrined it with a stage and auditorium with standing
                area for
                thousands. There are full light-show capabilities (on days that the town’s electricity supply is
                functioning),
                you name it.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="Moongirl-and-the-Bullhorns">Moongirl and the Bullhorns</h2>
            <div class="border3">
            <p>Therefore, without further adieu I would like to welcome you to present-day Saxeburg, and
                introduce you to <em>Moongirl
                    and the Bullhorns!</em> (Moongirl, please take a bow).</p>
            <p>Moongirl is the nubile lead singer of Saxeburg’s premier Rock and Roll show and the Bullhorns are
                the tightest
                backing band in the business. A dashing bunch of brutes too.</p>
            <p>Moongirl and her band put on a show every night of the year, and they love what they do. There is
                only one
                problem.</p>
            <p>The traffic in Saxeburg is bloody <em>terrible</em>!</p>

            <p>OK, so Moongirl has been spending the day at the beach, with her boys. Meanwhile she is
                head-lining at the Grand
                Théâtre de Rabat in NYC tonight. Let’s see if we can get her to the gig on time.</p>
            <p>I’m assuming you have an instance of Neo4j running on your machine. If you don’t <a
                    href="https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go google
                that</a> and we’ll
                regroup here.</p>

</code></pre>
            <p>This yields a graph that will look something like this:</p>
            <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I2xuxLK.png" alt="saxeburg-graph"></p>
            <p>The first thing that you might notice is that it looks nothing like our topographical map. So
                what gives?</p>
            </div>


            <h2 id="Graph-Theory">Graph Theory</h2>
            <div class="border3">
            <p>Well, you probably know that graph databases are based on a branch of mathematics, in the field
                of combinatorics called graph theory; that in fact graph theory itself emerged from an exercise in path-finding:</p>
            <p>Euler’s solution of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg"
                                          target="_blank"
                                          rel="noopener">Königsberg bridge problem</a> is considered to be the
                first theorem of graph theory and the first true proof in the theory of networks. Additionally Euler recognised
                that the key information was the number of bridges and the list of their endpoints rather than their exact positions.</p>
            <p>So there’s that.</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="More-Graph-Theory">More Graph Theory</h2>

            <div class="border3">
            <p>But it is quite a rabbit hole, actually.</p>
            <p>While combinatorial problems have been considered since antiquity and graph theory emerged some
                three hundred
                years ago, network structures remain an <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01144.pdf"
                                                           target="_blank"
                                                           rel="noopener">area of research interest</a> to this
                day.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the practical ramifications are endless. Some examples of applied graph theory are:</p>
            <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>Recommendation engines</li>
                <li>Root cause analysis</li>
                <li>Fraud Detection</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Something that makes Neo4j so compelling is that it puts graph algorithms for real-time
                transactional data at
                your fingertips.</p>
            <p>In fact later in this series we will be applying graph theory to solve a crime. Or maybe
                (shocking thought) to
                get away with one. Which will it be?</p>
            <p>Of course this is a suspenseful blog series so you’ll have to wait. In the meantime our sassy
                urbanite is
                starting to get tetchy about being late for her gig, so we’d better press on!</p>
            </div>


            <h2 id="Bidirectional-Relationships">Bidirectional Relationships</h2>
            <div class="border3">
            <p>Something else that you might notice is that the <code>HAS_ROUTE</code> relationships are
                directional - we can
                see this on the visualisation, because, well, they have arrows on one end.</p>
            <p>However, we have actually modelled Saxeburg as an undirected graph. <em>But</em>, all
                relationships in Neo4j are
                <em>directed</em>.</p>
            <p>So what is happening here? Well, the CYPHER query language allows us to ignore direction when it
                is not relevant.
                You can see an example of that on the merge statements to create the <code>HAS_ROUTE</code>
                relationships, and
                we’ll employ it again in a moment.</p>
            </div>


            <h2 id="Exploring-Routes">Exploring Routes</h2>
            <div class="border3">
            <p>Let’s run the following CYPHER:</p>
            <pre><code class="cypher hljs"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">MATCH</span> (<span
                    class="hljs-selector-tag">n</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:Metro)-</span><span

                    class="hljs-selector-tag">-</span>(<span

                        class="hljs-selector-tag">m</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.name</span>
  <span class="hljs-selector-tag">LIMIT</span> 5;
</code></pre>
            <p>This yields the following results:</p>
            <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/S7rCAAa.png" alt=""></p>
            <p>We can see that each <code>Metro</code> has a route to various other metros, and that the average
                travel time has
                been recorded.</p>
            </div>


            <h2 id="Most-Expedient-Route">Most Expedient Route</h2>
            <div class="border3">
            <p>Using the information at hand, we can now easily find the most expedient route from Cavite Island

            <h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="border3">
            <p>Today we learned how to use Neo4j to perform traffic routing.</p>
            <p>There is a lot more that we could do, however I would like <em>you</em> to think about it, and
                see where it leads
                you. How would you extend the model? Maybe handling delays? Turn by turn directions? What about
                performance
                concerns with much larger datasets?</p>
            <p>Have a try for yourself and tweet your discoveries to <strong><a

            <p>We also learned today that:</p>
            <ul class="bulletList">
                <li>Neo4j is accessible. We can analyse network structures and solve real-world problems,
                    without necessarily
                    needing to know a lot about graph theory or combinatorics.
                </li>
                <li>Network structures have tremendous <em>plasticity</em>. We can enhance our model to
                    encompass evolving
                    requirements. And because Neo4j is transactional we can be assured of data consistency for
                    large-scale,
                    fluid networks. This is a powerful combination. In fact it makes Neo4j compelling for AI
                    applications. We
                    will explore that, with Moongirl, in a future post.
                </li>
            </ul>
